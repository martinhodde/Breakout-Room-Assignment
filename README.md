# Breakout Room Assignment Project

Our job is to place n students into Zoom breakout rooms. For each pair of students i and j, there is one value h<sub>ij</sub> quantifying how much happiness these two students give each other and one value s<sub>ij</sub> quantifying how much stress they give each other. The total happiness value of a room H<sub>room</sub> is the sum of the happiness values h<sub>ij</sub> of every student pair in that room, and the total stress value of a room S<sub>room</sub> is the sum of the stress values s<sub>ij</sub> of every student pair in that room. Given that trying to eliminate student stress is impossible, we have settled with keeping total student stress low enough so that it does not surpass S<sub>max</sub>/k in each room, where k is the number of breakout rooms we choose to open. Our goal is to maximize total happiness H<sub>total</sub> across all rooms, while keeping the total stress below the threshold S<sub>max</sub>/k in each room.
